My take on the classic Space Invaders arcade game, built with Python and Pygame.

## About

This is a personal project I worked on to practice Python programming and game development. It's a fully functional Space Invaders game with custom graphics support and classic gameplay mechanics.

**Author:** Hassan Ali  
**GitHub:** [@FallenGodfather](https://github.com/FallenGodfather)

## Features

- Classic Space Invaders gameplay
- Custom image support (PNG/JPG)
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty  
- Score tracking
- Simple controls (arrow keys + spacebar)
- Pause/resume functionality

## How to Play

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: Move your ship
- **Spacebar**: Shoot / Start game / Restart
- **ESC**: Quit game

### Objective
Destroy all the alien invaders before they reach the bottom of the screen or destroy you!

## Installation

Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Then just run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Custom Graphics

The game will automatically use custom images if you place them in the game directory:

- `spaceship.png` - Your ship sprite
- `alien.png` - Alien enemy sprite  
- `bullet.png` - Bullet sprite

If no custom images are found, the game uses simple colored rectangles that work just fine.

## Game Structure

```

├── game.py          # Core game logic  
├── player.py        # Player ship class

├── bullet.py        # Bullet projectile class
├── settings.py      # Game constants and config
└── README.md        # This file
```

## Technical Notes

- Built with **Python 3** and **Pygame 2**
- Runs at 60 FPS
- Uses sprite groups for efficient collision detection
- Object-oriented design for easy modification

## Development

This was a fun weekend project to get back into game programming. The code is intentionally kept simple and readable - feel free to fork it and add your own features!

Some ideas for expansion:
- Sound effects
- Power-ups
- Different alien types
- Boss battles
- High score system

## License

Feel free to use this code for learning or your own projects. No restrictions.
